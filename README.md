# First GraphQl exercise

This is a remake of the first exercise we had in our API-course.

## Description

We use express server, apollo and GraphQL to create a simple array in an excel doc. We use sheetdb.io to store our data. The purpose of this exercise was to combine our newly gotten knowledge in back end programming with our front end knowledge to create a simple site with basic styling for the user to make requests such as get, post etc to our own API. Besides GraphQL, we use javascript and some css.

### Dependencies

- Node v18.12.1
